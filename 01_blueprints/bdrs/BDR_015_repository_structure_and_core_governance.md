# Business Decision Record: BDR_015 — Repository Structure & Core Governance

## 1. Status & Metadata
* **BDR ID:** BDR_015
* **Date/Timestamp:** 2026-06-03 UTC
* **Type:** Core Infrastructure Policy — Supersedes BDR_010
* **Impacted Scope Tracks:** All Agentic Governance Lifecycle
  Documents

## 2. Context & Problem Statement
BDR_010 established the initial governance plane structure
but placed BDRs and BREQs as independent sibling folders
under `/governance/`. This structure fails to reflect their
shared semantic identity as business layer artifacts,
creating ambiguity about which folder layer an artifact
belongs to and violating the principle of semantic
cohesion established in BDR_011.

## 3. The Business Decision (The "What")
The repository root is strictly divided into two distinct
logical planes: Execution (Development) and Governance
(Specification).

### 3.1 The Governance Plane (`/governance/`)
All automated lifecycle agents operate exclusively within
this directory tree. The Librarian enforces this sub-tree
structure organized by semantic layer:

* **`/governance/business/`** — The unified business layer.
  Contains all strategic direction records (BDRs) and
  business requirements (BREQs), organized in dedicated
  sub-folders:
    * `/governance/business/BDRs/` — Business Decision
      Records. Strategic mandates and constitutional rules.
    * `/governance/business/BREQs/` — Business Requirements.
      Operational rules and agent mandates derived from BDRs.
    * Business baseline artifacts (e.g., `01_business_request.md`)
      live directly in `/governance/business/`.

* **`/governance/product/`** — Product layer. Contains
  Product Decision Records (PDRs) and Product Requirements
  (PREQs), organized in dedicated sub-folders:
    * `/governance/product/PDRs/`
    * `/governance/product/PREQs/`

* **`/governance/architecture/`** — Architecture layer.
  Contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs),
  Architectural Requirements (AREQs), and Technical
  Determination Records (TDRs), organized in dedicated
  sub-folders:
    * `/governance/architecture/ADRs/`
    * `/governance/architecture/AREQs/`
    * `/governance/architecture/TDRs/`

* **`/governance/technical/`** — Technical layer. Contains
  Technical Requirements (TREQs), data schemas, and API
  contracts, organized in dedicated sub-folders:
    * `/governance/technical/TREQs/`
    * `/governance/technical/schemas/`

* **`/governance/templates/`** — Centralized master YAML
  schemas and clean markdown scaffolding forms.

* **`/governance/bprops/`** — Active engine history logs,
  metadata tokens, and operational snapshots.
    * `/governance/bprops/history/` — Global audit ledgers
      and change provenance chains.
    * `/governance/bprops/rollbacks/` — Immutable snapshots
      of rejected or failed structural states.

### 3.2 The Development Plane (`/src/`)
Reserved entirely for codebase logic, application source
files, components, and technical unit tests. Governance
agents do not alter this directory without explicit,
human-directed deployment triggers.

## 4. Strategic Rationale & Consequences (The "Why")
* **Semantic Cohesion:** BDRs and BREQs share the same
  decision layer — business intent. Co-locating them under
  `/governance/business/` makes their relationship explicit
  and structurally enforced.
* **Layer Clarity:** Every artifact's location in the
  filesystem now directly communicates which governance
  layer it belongs to, eliminating ambiguity for agents
  and human operators.
* **Consistent Pattern:** All four governance layers
  (business, product, architecture, technical) follow
  the same sub-folder pattern, making the structure
  predictable and extensible.
* **Downstream Alignment:** The Librarian must enforce
  this structure on every file write operation. Any
  artifact placed outside its designated layer folder
  must be rejected and flagged via TQUERY.
