# Business Decision Record: BDR_014 — Multi-Project Registry & Cross-Intelligence Protocol

## 1. Status & Metadata
* **BDR ID:** BDR_014
* **Date/Timestamp:** 2026-06-03 UTC
* **Type:** Operational Configuration Policy
* **Impacted Scope Tracks:** Governs all multi-project
  interactions; extends BDR_001 and BDR_006

## 2. Context & Problem Statement
The framework is designed to govern individual projects in
isolated repositories. However, operators running multiple
projects simultaneously risk scope overlap, feature
duplication, and architectural conflicts between projects
without a mechanism to detect and surface these issues.
The framework must define how projects remain isolated while
enabling controlled cross-project intelligence to prevent
operators from inadvertently working against themselves.

## 3. The Business Decision (The "What")

### 3.1 Project Isolation Principle
Each project governed by the framework must reside in its
own dedicated repository with its own complete and
independent `/governance/` plane. No governance artifacts
from one project may be referenced as active dependencies
in another project's governance plane. Projects are
structurally sovereign units.

### 3.2 The Project Registry
A Project Registry is hereby established as the single
source of truth for all active projects under the operator's
governance ecosystem:
* **Scope:** The registry is a lightweight index — it does
  not replicate governance artifacts. It only captures each
  project's identity, sealed scope summary, and repository
  reference.
* **Location:** The registry lives outside any individual
  project repository in a dedicated operator-level governance
  space.
* **Mandatory Fields per Project Entry:**
    * Project ID and name
    * Repository reference
    * Sealed scope summary (derived from its active BDRs)
    * Current lifecycle status (Active, Paused, Archived)
* **Custodianship:** The registry is read-accessible to all
  agents across all projects. Write access is exclusively
  held by the Librarian of the project being registered,
  authorized by the HITL.

### 3.3 Cross-Intelligence Protocol
Agents do not autonomously monitor other projects. Instead,
cross-project intelligence is activated naturally through
the existing escalation process:
* When any agent detects that a feature, requirement, or
  architectural decision may overlap with or belong to
  another project, it consults the Project Registry as
  read-only context before issuing its structured conflict
  or escalation report to the HITL.
* The HITL receives the enriched report with explicit
  references to the potentially affected project and makes
  the final routing decision.
* No agent may autonomously move, copy, or reference
  artifacts between project repositories without explicit
  HITL authorization.

### 3.4 Anti-Overlap Mandate
The Business Catalyst of any active project is explicitly
mandated to consult the Project Registry during the initial
scope definition phase to verify that the incoming project's
scope does not duplicate or directly conflict with an
existing active project's sealed scope.

## 4. Strategic Rationale & Consequences (The "Why")
* **Project Sovereignty:** Each project remains a clean,
  self-contained governance unit with no implicit
  dependencies on other projects.
* **Operator Clarity:** The Project Registry gives the
  operator a single place to understand their full
  development ecosystem without navigating multiple
  repositories.
* **Conflict Prevention:** By consulting the registry at
  scope definition time, the framework catches overlap
  before development begins rather than after resources
  have been invested.
* **Scalability:** The protocol scales naturally — adding
  a new project requires only a registry entry, not
  changes to existing project governance planes.
* **Process Reuse:** The cross-intelligence mechanism
  reuses the existing escalation and conflict loops
  already defined in BREQ_006, requiring no new agent
  behavior — only new context.
