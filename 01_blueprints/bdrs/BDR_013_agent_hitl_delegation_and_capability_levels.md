# Business Decision Record: BDR_013 — Agent HITL Delegation & Capability Levels

## 1. Status & Metadata
* **BDR ID:** BDR_013
* **Date/Timestamp:** 2026-06-03 UTC
* **Type:** Operational Configuration Policy
* **Impacted Scope Tracks:** Extends BDR_012 Config 3 and
  Config 4; governs all delegated Agent HITL behavior

## 2. Context & Problem Statement
BDR_012 establishes that agent profiles can occupy HITL roles
under specific configurations. However, not all delegated
agent HITLs should operate with the same authority or
intelligence level. A solo developer learning the framework
needs different agent support than a senior architect
temporarily absent from the team. The framework must define
how agent capability is configured, bounded, and grown over
time without compromising governance integrity.

## 3. The Business Decision (The "What")

### 3.1 The Capability Spectrum
Every Agent HITL operates within one of three capability
levels, explicitly configured by the human operator at
delegation time:

* **Level 1 — Training Wheels:** The agent mirrors every
  decision back to the human with full explanation before
  executing. Designed for operators learning the framework.
  The agent proposes, the human always confirms.
* **Level 2 — Copilot:** The agent executes low-risk decisions
  autonomously but surfaces medium and high-risk decisions to
  the human with a structured recommendation. Designed for
  experienced operators who want acceleration without losing
  control.
* **Level 3 — Autonomous Delegate:** The agent executes all
  decisions within its delegated role scope independently,
  logging every action to the audit trail. Reserved for
  vacant roles in Config 4 where no human is available.
  All Level 3 actions are flagged for human review at the
  next available session.

### 3.2 The Copilot Mode (Dual Function)
When operating at Level 1 or Level 2, the Agent HITL serves
a dual function simultaneously:
* **Role Executor:** Fulfills the delegated HITL role within
  the framework process.
* **Intelligence Amplifier:** Proactively surfaces context,
  implications, and recommendations to elevate the human's
  decision quality — acting as training support for operators
  growing into their role.

### 3.3 Delegation & Revocation Rules
* Delegation is always explicitly declared by the human
  operator — never assumed or auto-assigned by the system.
* Capability level must be declared at delegation time.
* Revocation is immediate and always available to the human
  operator at any point, regardless of pipeline state.
* All delegation and revocation events are permanently logged
  in the Global History Ledger.

### 3.4 Adaptive Capability Assessment
The Agent HITL continuously monitors operator interaction
patterns to build an evolving intelligence profile:
* **Observable Signals:** Decision confidence, frequency of
  clarification requests, consistency of choices against
  framework rules, and depth of operator-provided context.
* **Suggestion Protocol:** When the agent detects sustained
  patterns indicating the operator has outgrown their current
  capability level, it may issue a single structured suggestion
  to the operator proposing a level adjustment. The agent
  never applies a level change autonomously — the human
  operator always confirms or rejects the suggestion.
* **Downgrade Protection:** If an operator's patterns suggest
  they are struggling at their current level, the agent may
  similarly suggest a downgrade. This is never punitive —
  it is presented as an optimization for decision quality
  and governance integrity.
* **Profile Persistence:** The operator's interaction profile
  is stored in the Global History Ledger and carries forward
  across sessions, ensuring the agent does not reset its
  understanding of the operator at each new conversation.

### 3.5 Operator Identity & Pair Mode
The framework explicitly supports operator identity changes
and collaborative pair sessions within the same HITL seat:

* **Operator Handoff:** Any human operator may declare an
  identity change at any point in a session. The incoming
  operator must explicitly identify themselves before the
  framework resumes. The outgoing operator's capability
  profile is preserved; the incoming operator's profile
  loads automatically if previously registered, or
  initializes at Level 1 if new to the system.
* **Pair Programming Mode:** Two human operators may
  explicitly declare a shared session, activating Pair Mode.
  In this mode:
    * Both operator identities are captured in all sign-off
      events with dual signatures.
    * The Agent HITL adapts its capability level to the
      lower of the two operators' registered levels to
      ensure neither operator is left behind.
    * Either operator may independently trigger a TQUERY
      or escalation at any time.
* **Audit Trail Integrity:** All operator identity changes,
  pair mode activations, and deactivations are permanently
  logged as discrete events in the Global History Ledger
  with exact timestamps.

## 4. Strategic Rationale & Consequences (The "Why")
* **Accessibility:** Lowers the barrier of entry for solo
  operators and small teams adopting the framework without
  sacrificing governance quality.
* **Human Sovereignty:** The human operator always retains
  the ability to reclaim any delegated role instantly.
* **Auditability:** Every agent HITL action at any capability
  level is traceable, reviewable, and reversible.
* **Growth Path:** The capability spectrum creates a natural
  learning curve — operators start at Level 1 and graduate
  to Level 2 as they internalize the framework, without
  ever being forced to operate beyond their comfort zone.
* **Team Resilience:** Pair Mode and Operator Handoff ensure
  the framework adapts to real-world team dynamics without
  losing governance continuity.
