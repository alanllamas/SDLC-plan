# Business Decision Record: BDR_012 — HITL Operational Spectrum

## 1. Status & Metadata
* **BDR ID:** BDR_012
* **Date/Timestamp:** 2026-06-03 UTC
* **Type:** Operational Configuration Policy
* **Impacted Scope Tracks:** Governs all HITL interaction 
  mandates across BREQ_004 through BREQ_011

## 2. Context & Problem Statement
The framework was initially designed assuming a fully staffed 
human team occupying each HITL role. However, real-world 
deployment scenarios range from solo operators to incomplete 
teams, requiring the framework to remain operational and 
governable regardless of human availability at any given role.

## 3. The Business Decision (The "What")
The framework hereby recognizes four canonical operational 
configurations, each fully supported and governed by explicit 
rules:

* **Config 1 — Full Human Team:** Every HITL role is occupied 
  by a distinct human operator. The framework operates as 
  originally designed with no modifications.
* **Config 2 — Single Human Operator:** One human sequentially 
  occupies all HITL roles. The framework must enforce mandatory 
  cooling-off gates between role transitions to prevent 
  self-approval conflicts.
* **Config 3 — Human + Delegated Agent HITLs:** The human 
  operator retains strategic authority and explicitly delegates 
  specific HITL roles to agent profiles on a per-session or 
  permanent basis. Delegation and revocation are always 
  human-initiated.
* **Config 4 — Incomplete Team with Temporary Agent HITL:** 
  A human team missing one or more members temporarily assigns 
  agent profiles to vacant roles. Agent authority is explicitly 
  time-boxed and auditable, and reverts automatically upon 
  human reinstatement.

## 4. Strategic Rationale & Consequences (The "Why")
* **Operational Resilience:** Prevents the framework from 
  becoming inoperable due to team size or availability 
  constraints.
* **Scope Flexibility:** Allows solo developers and small teams 
  to adopt the framework without requiring a full organizational 
  structure.
* **Governance Integrity:** Regardless of configuration, all 
  decisions remain traceable, auditable, and reversible — 
  the human sovereign authority is never structurally eliminated,
  only temporarily delegated.
* **Downstream Alignment:** All BREQs governing individual 
  agent mandates must respect the active operational 
  configuration declared at project initialization.
