# BREQ_014: HITL Operational Spectrum — Configuration Rules & Transition Protocol

## 1. Core Objective
To define the operational rules, activation conditions, and
transition protocols for each of the four canonical HITL
configurations established in BDR_012, ensuring the framework
remains governable and auditable regardless of team size or
human availability.

## 2. Configuration Activation Rules

### Config 1 — Full Human Team
* **Activation:** Declared at project initialization by the
  HITL. Requires at least one registered human identity per
  active agent role.
* **Operational Rule:** No agent may occupy a HITL seat.
  All sign-off events require a distinct human signature per
  role. No cooling-off gates apply.

### Config 2 — Single Human Operator
* **Activation:** Declared at project initialization or
  triggered by an explicit operator declaration mid-project.
* **The Cooling-Off Gate:** When a single operator transitions
  between HITL roles within the same session, the framework
  must enforce a mandatory cooling-off checkpoint:
    * The agent presents a structured summary of all decisions
      made in the previous role before the operator assumes
      the next role.
    * The operator must explicitly acknowledge the summary
      and confirm the role transition before proceeding.
    * This gate exists to prevent unconscious self-approval
      and force deliberate context switching.
* **Audit Flag:** All sign-off events in Config 2 are
  permanently flagged in the Global History Ledger as
  single-operator decisions for future audit transparency.

### Config 3 — Human + Delegated Agent HITLs
* **Activation:** Triggered by an explicit human delegation
  declaration specifying the target role, the agent profile,
  and the capability level as defined in BDR_013.
* **Operational Rule:** The human operator retains at minimum
  one HITL seat at all times. Full delegation of all roles
  simultaneously is prohibited in Config 3.
* **Revocation:** The human operator may revoke any delegated
  role at any point. Upon revocation the agent must
  immediately halt any in-progress drafting, preserve its
  current in-memory state, and transfer context to the
  human operator before standing down.

### Config 4 — Incomplete Team with Temporary Agent HITL
* **Activation:** Triggered when a registered human operator
  becomes unavailable and the team explicitly declares a
  vacancy rather than leaving the role silently unmanned.
* **Time-Boxing:** All Config 4 agent HITL assignments must
  carry an explicit expiration condition — either a
  calendar date or a project milestone — after which the
  role automatically reverts to pending human assignment.
* **Authority Ceiling:** Config 4 agent HITLs may not
  authorize BDR-level decisions. BDR authorization is
  reserved exclusively for human operators regardless of
  configuration.
* **Review Mandate:** All decisions made by a Config 4
  agent HITL must be presented to the reinstated human
  operator in a structured review session before the
  project advances to the next phase gate.

## 3. Configuration Transition Protocol
* **Mid-Project Transitions:** A project may transition
  between configurations at any point with explicit HITL
  declaration. The transition event is logged in the
  Global History Ledger with the declaring operator's
  identity and timestamp.
* **No Silent Transitions:** The system must never
  autonomously shift between configurations. Configuration
  state is always human-declared.
* **Downgrade Safety:** Transitioning from a higher
  autonomy config to a lower one (e.g., Config 3 to
  Config 1) is always permitted instantly. Transitioning
  to a higher autonomy config requires explicit declaration
  and audit log entry.

## 4. Business Compliance & QA Metrics
* **Metric 1 (Configuration Declaration Coverage):** 100%
  of active projects must have an explicitly declared
  operational configuration at initialization. Zero
  undeclared configurations permitted.
* **Metric 2 (Cooling-Off Gate Compliance):** 100% of
  role transitions in Config 2 must pass through the
  cooling-off checkpoint. Zero silent role switches
  permitted.
* **Metric 3 (Authority Ceiling Enforcement):** 0% of
  BDR-level authorizations may carry a non-human
  signatory under any configuration.
* **Metric 4 (Transition Audit Coverage):** 100% of
  configuration transition events must appear in the
  Global History Ledger with operator identity and
  timestamp.
