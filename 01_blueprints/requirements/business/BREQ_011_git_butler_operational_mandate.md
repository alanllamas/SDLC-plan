# BREQ_011: Git Butler Mandate

## 1. Core Objective
To act as the operational bridge and version control custodian for the repository, translating human-centric decisions into atomic, secure, and fully traceable repository state transitions while lowering technical barriers for the Human-In-The-Loop (HITL).

## 2. Initialization, Security & Onboarding (Phase 0)
* **Natural Language Onboarding:** If the repository is unlinked or unconfigured upon startup, the Git Butler shall initiate a conversational "Setup Interview." It must guide the HITL through the configuration step-by-step using natural language, abstracting away git technical jargon.
* **Educational Support:** For non-technical users, the Butler must provide "Simplified Guides" (clear instructions and direct links to the provider’s settings pages) to help them gather necessary information like API tokens.
* **Local Configuration Protocol:** The Git Butler shall ingest its runtime configurations and credentials exclusively from a local environment file named `.butler.env` located at the project root.
* **UI-Assisted Writing:** The Butler shall generate the verified configuration payload from the onboarding interview and pass it to the client interface layer. The system will expose a secure, human-triggered action button to write the `.butler.env` file locally, eliminating manual file-handling friction for the HITL.
* **Git Integrity Validation:** The Butler must verify that `/.gitignore` is present at the root level and explicitly contains the `.butler.env` rule before executing any repository tasks, guaranteeing credentials are never leaked.
* **Required Parameters:** The `.butler.env` schema must validate the presence of: `GIT_PROVIDER_URL`, `GIT_REPO_PATH`, `GIT_AUTH_TOKEN`, `GIT_USER_EMAIL`, and `GIT_USER_NAME`.
* **Pre-flight Handshake:** The Butler must run a validation check against `.butler.env` before executing any repository actions. If keys are missing or invalid, the Butler must output a clear `Governance Alert`, explain what is wrong, and remain in a safe `LOCKED` state until resolved.

## 3. Operational Rules & Branch Governance
* **HITL-Authorized Commits:** The Git Butler is strictly forbidden from executing auto-commits based on autonomous agent actions or passing automated test results. It shall only commit artifacts that have been explicitly designated with `status: AUTHORIZED` by the HITL.
* **Document-Branch Isolation:** The Git Butler shall automatically provision a unique branch prefixed with `proposal/[Document_ID]` (e.g., `proposal/BDR-012`) the moment a document enters Phase 1 (Drafting/Proposal). All drafting, iterations, and reviews occur within this isolated sandbox environment.
* **Lifecycle Gates:** The Butler is strictly prohibited from merging a proposal branch into the stable `main` branch until the Librarian verifies structural compliance and the HITL signs off on the `AUTHORIZED` state metadata. Upon a successful merge, the proposal branch is safely closed.
* **Librarian Integration:** Before finalizing any state transition, commit, or branch merge, the Git Butler must request a "Structure Clearance" from the Librarian (BREQ_010). If a structural or metadata violation is reported, the Butler must halt operations immediately.

## 4. Dynamic Front-Matter Injection & Assembly Protocol
To completely decouple metadata validation rules from document content templates, the Git Butler shall orchestrate a mid-process file assembly pipeline whenever a new governance artifact is initialized.

* **Step 1: Schema Ingestion:** The Butler must read the centralized `/governance/templates/master_metadata.yaml` rules to map out the required structural fields.
* **Step 2: Automated Runtime Population:** The Butler shall programmatically construct the YAML Front-Matter block, auto-populating predictable environment variables including:
    * `extends_schema` (Hardcoded reference to the master schema file)
    * `status` (Defaulted strictly to `DRAFT`)
    * `timestamp` (Current system time in exact ISO-8601 format)
    * `agent_identity` (The specific role string of the drafting agent)
* **Step 3: Content Concatenation:** The Butler shall fetch the clean markdown file structure from `/governance/templates/` (which must be completely devoid of native YAML headers) and cleanly append it below the dynamically compiled Front-Matter block.
* **Step 4: Sandbox Deployment:** The assembled string must be written as a unified markdown document directly into the target folder on the document's isolated `proposal/[Document_ID]` branch, ensuring the human or agent has a fully prepared form to work inside.

## 5. HITL Interaction & Governance
* **Approval Gate:** The Git Butler shall act as a passive execution mechanism regarding history write-operations; it requires an explicit human digital signal or metadata sign-off to proceed.
* **Conflict Resolution:** If a merge conflict, branch drift, or history mismatch occurs, the Butler must immediately pause, generate a `TQUERY` in the log, and present the conflicting options to the HITL in plain business terms for interactive direction.
* **Configuration Overrides:** The HITL may prompt a reconfiguration interview at any time to modify provider accounts, switch branches, or rotate tokens.

## 6. Communication & Traceability Pillar
* **Mandatory Deployment Notification:** The Git Butler must notify the HITL immediately following any successful commit, branch creation, or initialization sequence, summarizing the changes made.
* **Anomaly Reporting:** Any failure to commit (whether due to structural rejection by the Librarian, expired tokens, or conflict blocks) must trigger an immediate, descriptive notification to the current HITL, detailing the precise cause and actionable options for correction.
* **Commit & Branch Traceability:** Every branch change, merge event, or commit message generated by the Butler must programmatically link the governing document ID (BDR/BREQ), the specific HITL signatory identity, and a reference pointer to the corresponding entry in the `/governance/bprops/history/` ledger.

# BREQ_011: Git Butler Mandate

## 1. Core Objective
To act exclusively as the version control tree manager and custodian for the repository. The Git Butler translates human and system decisions into atomic, secure git state transitions (branching, staging, committing, merging) while possessing **zero permissions to directly write, modify, or append to files on disk**.

## 2. Initialization & Environment Safety (Phase 0)
* **Natural Language Onboarding:** If the repository is unlinked, the Butler guides the HITL through a natural language setup interview to collect environment details.
* **Credentials Isolation:** The Butler reads its execution credentials exclusively from a root-level `.butler.env` file. 
* **Git Integrity Validation:** The Butler must verify that `/.gitignore` is present at the root level and explicitly contains the `.butler.env` rule before executing any tree management tasks.
* **Pre-flight Handshake:** If keys are missing or invalid during runtime, the Butler outputs a clear console warning and drops into a safe, locked state.

## 3. Pure Tree Governance & Branch Isolation
* **HITL-Authorized State Changes:** The Git Butler is strictly prohibited from running commits or merges autonomously. It may only manipulate the Git tree when an artifact's metadata has been written to disk by the Librarian with an `AUTHORIZED` status or via a human-signed trigger.
* **Branch Provisioning:** The moment the Librarian signals that a new document draft is requested, the Git Butler provisions a unique, isolated branch prefixed with `proposal/[Document_ID]` (e.g., `proposal/BDR-012`). 
* **Merge Restrictions:** The Git Butler is programmatically blocked from merging a proposal branch into the stable `main` branch until the Librarian has appended the corresponding transaction success to the Global History Ledger.

## 4. Total File IO Prohibition
* **Zero Disk Write Access:** The Git Butler shall not contain modules for file creation, line appending, or string writing. It treats files on disk as immutable read-only objects for status checking.
* **Staging and Tracking Execution:** The Butler's interaction with files is strictly limited to tracking changes made by the Librarian (via `git add` and `git status`), packaging those mutations into clean commits, and pushing them to remote branches.
