# BREQ_013: Global History Ledger Management

## 1. Core Objective
To maintain an immutable, chronological, and append-only record of every structural and status transition within the `/governance/` plane. This ledger serves as the single source of truth for repository history, ensuring perfect traceability across all multi-agent operations.

## 2. Custoded by the Librarian (File I/O Monopoly Enforced)
Unlike standard file operations handled by execution mechanisms, the Global History Ledger is under the exclusive lock and key of the **Librarian (BREQ_010)**.
* **Exclusive Write Authority:** Only the Librarian has the operational authority to append data to the history ledger files located in `/governance/bprops/history/`. 
* **The Gatekeeper Check:** The Librarian will write to the ledger *after* validating document structure and *before* granting clearance to the Git Butler to finalize a branch merge into `main`.

## 3. Root Causality Tracking (Root Agent vs. Executor)
To ensure the ledger reflects actual business logic intent, entries must preserve root-level accountability:
* **The Originating Agent:** The ledger must log the identity of the **Root Agent** that triggered the proposal or configuration change (e.g., `Business Catalyst`, `Product Orchestrator`), explicitly bypassing technical handler identities like the `Git Butler`.

## 4. Human-Readable Signatures
Cryptic hexadecimal hashes or system-generated machine tokens are strictly forbidden within the human sign-off blocks. 
* All `hitl_signatory` entries must record a plain-text, human-readable identity string (e.g., `"Jane Doe via Console Approval"`) to guarantee immediate audit clarity for any human reviewer.

## 5. The Programmatic Ledger Entry Template & Schema
To append a transaction record to the history sequence, the Librarian must fetch the master template located at **`/governance/templates/LEDGER_ENTRY_template.yaml`**. 

The Librarian must programmatically populate the block in-memory before appending it cleanly to the active chronological transaction file:

```yaml
- transaction_id: "TX_2026_00001"       # Continuous incremental sequence ID
  timestamp: "2026-06-01T06:20:00Z"     # ISO-8601 standard
  event_type: "SUPERSESSION"            # CREATION | SUPERSESSION | DEPRECATION | TQUERY_RESOLUTION
  
  root_causality:
    originating_agent: "Business Catalyst" # The root agent that birthed the change
    target_branch: "proposal/BDR-010"
